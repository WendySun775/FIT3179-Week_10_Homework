# Life Expectancy Evolution: Between Past and Future

This visualization illustrates the evolution of life expectancy over time, exploring changes between the past, present and future. It also delves into the effectiveness of life expectancy as a measure of years of life between people within the same country, drawing insights from [Peltzman's study(2009)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.23.4.175). Moreover, it offers readers an opportunity to explore in-depth the factors influencing changes in life expectancy, leaving room for their own interpretations and analysis.

## Project Description

This data visualization project focus on the evolution of life expectancy worldwide and utilizes the Vega-Lite library for creating maps and diagrams. The objective was to demonstrate advanced data visualization techniques acquired during the semester, showcasing their versatility in a novel context. Leveraging Vega-Lite and, when necessary, approved alternate libraries, we meticulously crafted a publicly accessible web page hosted on GitHub.
